# **Benjamin Tozier's Project Portfolio**

## Summary

I am a software engineer with a focus on software, hardware, and the technologies where the two meet. Additionally, I possess a fascination with math, physics, and robotics. Thusly, I have started working specifically to develop projects focused around those and a smattering of other assorted topics. This portfolio is intended to be a collection of those projects.
